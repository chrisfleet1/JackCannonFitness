Jack really knows what he is doing and always listens to your needs to which he creates a regime that is fun, exciting and really gets results. Every session Jack is so supportive and gives great encouragement with all exercises! He understands what you can and can’t do and always makes sure you reach your full potential! Jack, thank you for everything, you have changed my health and well-being for the better and have  made me a stronger and happier person! Here’s to many more sessions and great music! ☺️'
